<p align="center">🏡 I’m from Brazil ⚽️ </p>

<p align="center">💻 I'm a computer science student better known as "the nerds"🤓🤓</p>
  
<p align="center">📐 I am currently learning about UX design. And I'm really excited about the design universe 🤩🤩🎨📱 </p>
  
<p align="center">🎯 My goals for this year is to get involved in more projects and get a job👨🏻‍💻</p>



<p align="center">And yes, it's true that I spend almost 90% of my day in front of the computer 🕑🕝🕘 kkkkk but that's where I learn a multitude of things like making drawing animation at the level of a child who is in preschool  👶🏻🖌 kkkkkkk. I also spend my time 📴 petting my cats 🐱🐱 and watching a lot of animes!!!!🌈 
I truly believe that the journey of knowledge never ends so I'm always looking to learn new things or improve my skills 📊✔️</p>
