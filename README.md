:computer: I'm Web Developer!

:house_with_garden: Iâ€™m from Brazil.
:books: I am currently learning about UX design. And I'm really excited about the design universe.
:outbox_tray: 2021 Goals: create a new project and find a new job.


And yes, it's true that I spend almost 90% of my day in front of the computer. 
but that's where I learn a multitude of things like making drawing animation at the level of a child who is in preschool kkkkkkk. 
I also spend my time petting my cats and watching a lot of animes!!!!
Now let's talk about my professional and academic side. 
I truly believe that the journey of knowledge never ends so I'm always looking to learn new things or improve my skills.
